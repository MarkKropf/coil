# Coil

## Overview

**Coil**, a completely decentralized nodejs application to coordinate automation via gossipy communication.

Coil currently communicates between nodes using http calls. As long as one coil node is publicly reachable, all other nodes should be able to update their digests.

Early work to generate public/private key pairs for encrypted communication exists. Still working on moving all coil node communication over to encrypted communication.

*This is the first time I've done any node.js development, as such a lot of coil is implemented poorly.*
